### About EFO
The Norwegian Electrical Trade Organisation (EFO) works for the suppliers and wholesalers of electrotechnical equipment and solutions. This spans products from a single lightbulb to the biggest infrastructure projects. With 500 member and customer companies, our members' portfolios cover almost every type of electrotechnical product.

We have a product database that suppliers, wholesalers and installers use to communicate about products and their properties. We have about 300,000 products registered with us, most of which are active and currently accessible. As part of our mission to be the connector between the different roles in our industry, we have carefully selected the properties that products that are registered with us need to have. We check the products that are registered with us to make sure they have the necessary data.

### 1. Classification of product data quality
We would like to make an assessment of how good our data is, and if there any products that may need updating to adhere to our strict standards. This goes beyond a simple analysis, and is too much work to do manually, therefore we are looking into using some type of classification to find out more. For approved products, we have no further labelling that might indicate product data quality, and creating such a labelling or rating may be part of the project. The project needs at minimum to evaluate the products we currently have, and create a classification system that we can use going forwards.

### 2. Finding the correct ETIM-class with machine learning
It is up to our members and customers who own the products to correctly identify which product category each product belongs to. We would like to assist in this task, by creating a machine learning model which can recommend which ETIM (European Technical Information Model) class each product belongs in. This has proved to be a time-consuming process for some of our members, even if they already have lots of data stored about their products.
